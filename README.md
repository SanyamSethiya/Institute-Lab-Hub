# Institute-Lab-Hub

In today's scenario, due to digitalization and pandemics like covid people used to prefer online education also not all institutes have availability of resources which performs a drastic impact on practical education.

Presently each educational Institution has its workshops and labs that are utilized by the learners of that specific Institution. In Covid scenario, learners are primarily studying in online mode and even if some workshop/ lab based courses are conducted on campus, it's optional for the learners to join on campus. For education like Design education and other workshop/ lab-based education, learners need these facilities to work on their assignments and projects.

The Institute Lab Hub project is a web application which lets learners from different localities visit the labs and facilities of different institutes to meet their specified goals.

Let's consider the situation where an institute has a workshop on the Lathe machine.In ideal scenario any learner of the institute will have access to the lathe machine, but if any learner outside the institute who is taking an online course or the learner whose institute is unable to provide the facility of lathe machine, then in that case the learner will not be able to gain a hands-on experience. In this case the learner needs a service provider who will connect the institutes who are willing to provide the services and the learners who lack the services.

To resolve the issues like mentioned above and many more ,a web application can be developed which will gather the information of the facilities and services provided by the institutes and will help the learners to locate the resource they are looking for.

The application will consist of a list of different institutes with the details showing the availability of facilities with a fee charge for particular requirements and the learner will have an option among different institutes which help the learner to select the best institute.

All the institutes will provide details including their schedules in order to maintain the consistency of time and the learner will have a transparent look to the available resources/facilities.
